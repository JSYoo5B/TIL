""" Optimized solution
1. tokenize numbers list by 0 (product consisting 0 will lead 0)
2. drop the tokenized lists whether its length is less than 13
3. get 13 adjacent digits from tokenized number lists
4. calculate products, compare
5. preserve greater one
6. last preserved one is the greatest product
expected time complexity = O(m * n)
(m stands for digit, n stands for adjacent)
(decreases few product calculation)
